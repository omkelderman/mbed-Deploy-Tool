# mbed-Deploy-Tool

Tool to deploy an mbed-binary to the mbed-drive.

It also has an integrated serial-connection-thingy where you can read from the mbed USB Virtual Serial Port.
(Writing to it is not implemented yet!)

This project is mainly made because I needed it since I choose to use a offline toolchain to develop my mbed-programs. So don't expect high code-quality or anything ;)

## TODO
* Writing to the serial port
* safe the settings to a config-file or something so I don't have to set them everytime I open te tool
* I am open to ideas if this thing actually gets used by anyone other than myseld :P
